    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, you will access, process, analyze, and visualize satellite data in the context of example machine learning workflows. Machine learning tasks often involve a lot of data, and in Python, data is typically stored in memory as simple [NumPy](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/core/numpy.html) arrays. However, higher-level containers built on top of NumPy arrays provide more functionality for tabular data ([Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)), multidimensional gridded data ([xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org)), or out-of-core and distributed data ([Dask](http://dask.pydata.org)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Likely, your approach to data access will depend not only on the intended analysis, but on features of the data, such as size and location. First, to demonstrate simple cases, we will begin by reading in a local files with Pandas and xarray. Then, as many earth science datasets are large, gridded, and stored on remote servers, we will demonstrate the combined use of [Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io) and Dask libraries to efficiently fetch data.\n",

However, a core aspect of this data is the use of different wavelength-bands to capture multiple images of the same area - together providing much more information than a single image alone. This provides us with a stack of images for each region that we might be interested, and therefore the first three dimensions for each chunk of data consist of the spatial coordinates (x and y) and the wavelength-band. Additionally, we also have a time dimension, as we will consider a stack of images from different years to look at the change in the water level around [Walker Lake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Lake) in Nevada, USA.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "Before accessing any data, it's a good idea to start by learning about the context and details of the dataset. This will give you the intuition to make informed decisions as you form a processing and analysis pipeline. Once you have identified a dataset to use, tailor the data access approach given the features of the data, such as size and location. If your data is local and small, a reliable approach is to access the data with either Pandas or xarray, depending on whether the data is tabular or gridded. As earth science data is often large, multidimensional, and on a remote server, a powerful and increasingly common approach is to use the combination of Intake, Dask, and xarray. Once you have accessed data, visualize it with hvPlot to ensure that it matches your expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's next?\n",
    "After loading the data, you will typically need to process it in some way before it can be fed into a machine learning pipeline. We will cover an example of such processing in the next section."
