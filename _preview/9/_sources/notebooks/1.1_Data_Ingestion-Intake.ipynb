    "In the last notebook, you learned how to efficiently load data from the Microsoft Planetary Computer platform. If that approach works for you, please proceed to a workflow example. However, there are many other established approaches and platforms (e.g. [NASA EarthData](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search), [USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), [Google](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat), and [AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-landsat/)),  for loading Landsat data that may not preprocess the data in the exact same way or use a similar API. For this reason, in this notebook we will demonstrate common alternative approaches and techniques for general data access, centered around [Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io).\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "Before accessing any data, it's a good idea to start by learning about the context and details of the dataset. This will give you the intuition to make informed decisions as you form a processing and analysis pipeline. Once you have identified a dataset to use, tailor the data access approach given the features of the data, such as size and location. If your data is local and small, a reliable approach is to access the data with either Pandas or xarray, depending on whether the data is tabular or gridded. As earth science data is often large, multidimensional, and on a remote server, a powerful and increasingly common approach is to use the combination of Intake, Dask, and xarray. Once you have accessed data, visualize it with hvPlot to ensure that it matches your expectations.\n",

    "### What's next?\n",
    "After loading the data, you may need to process it in some way before it can be fed into your analysis workflow. We will cover an example of such processing in the next section."
