    "The data in this cookbook originally come from the [Landsat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsat_program) program, which is the longest record of moderate resolution multispectral data of the Earthâ€™s surface. This program has launched several different satellites spanning many years which are designated as Landsat 1-9.\n",

    "When accessing the data, it's important to keep in mind a couple key points. First, the instruments on different Landsat missions (1-9) varied in certain aspects. Second, Landsat data is available from multiple providers (USGS, NASA, Google, Microsoft, AWS, etc) but may vary in completeness and the level of processing applied. For the dataset that you end up using, it is crucial to review to relevant information from the particular data provider and the specific Landsat mission to understand the details, especially if you are comparing data across providers or missions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a common aspect of Landsat data is the use of different wavelength-bands to capture multiple images of the same area - together providing much more information about different features on the ground than a single image alone. This provides us with a stack of images for each spatial region that we might be interested.\n",
